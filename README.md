Shasta test

I changed some requirements of the test for make a more consistent UI for this app, like the login page without access to the other information.

I've been experimenting with hooks and state machines for the login part and I should have applied the same concept in the main component, userDetails, because it has some many states and it's necesary to group that states.

You can found preloaded a list of users (all with the same extra data, sorry for that), but for start, you can register 1 random user to get acces to the application.
